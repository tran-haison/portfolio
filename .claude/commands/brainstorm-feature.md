# Brainstorm Feature

Clarify a rough product or engineering idea into a BRD-lite brief (Why) with measurable business value.

**Input:** $ARGUMENTS

Optional args: slug=<feature>, ticket=<id/url>, mode=interactive|autonomous|channel, channel=<id>, auto_continue=true|false, profile=business|hybrid|technical.

## Instructions

Execute the following steps for **$ARGUMENTS**.


# Brainstorm Feature Workflow (BRD-lite / Why)

Goal: Convert vague intent into a compact BA-owned BRD-lite brief before PM PRD planning or technical design.

## Steps

1. Gather intent:
   - Load baseline BRD section, `common-business-requirements`, and `common-operator-profile`.
   - Infer `operator_profile` (business | hybrid | technical) from request phrasing; never ask the operator to self-rate. Carry it in the Handoff Payload.
   - Draft a provisional brief before asking.
   - Capture objective, sponsor, validation owner, stakeholders, users, pain/opportunity, value hypothesis, SMART metric, constraints, glossary, non-goals, and delivery context.
2. Explore options:
   - List 3 viable approaches.
   - Capture benefit, cost, risk, and unknowns for each.
   - Include funding/priority rationale.
   - Mark one recommended approach.
3. Pressure-test:
   - Keep BRD solution-free; route functional behavior to PRD/SRS.
   - Check security, privacy, accessibility, performance, data, rollout risks, and measurable approval criteria.
   - Treat non-critical unknowns as assumptions.
   - Split stakeholder asks into candidate `REQ-*` placeholders and flag platform, market, permission, and edge-case gaps for PM.
4. Decide:
   - Ask only true blocking product decisions, max 3 at a time.
   - Include a recommended default and 2-3 options for each question.
   - Record accepted approach and rejected alternatives.
   - Draft defaults before blocking: sponsor/validation owner = the requesting operator; SMART metric drafted from the stated pain (mark `assumed`); scope fence drafted from the request with explicit non-goals.
   - For `operator_profile=business`, present all three drafted defaults as one confirm-with-default question round (fits the max-3 rule) instead of blocking outright.
   - Continue on non-critical assumptions; return BLOCKED only when the operator rejects the drafted defaults, or in autonomous/channel mode with no confirmation channel available.
   - Save to `docs/brd/brd-[slug].md` when writes are allowed and route to `plan-feature`.

## Runtime Contract

- Use for rough feature, ops, or process-change ideas before PRD.
- Required inputs: rough intent plus any known owner, metric, or scope fence; missing items get drafted defaults, not an automatic block.
- Return BLOCKED only when the operator rejects drafted defaults for owner, measurable value, or scope boundary, or autonomous mode has no confirmation channel.

## Handoff Payload

- `slug`, `operator_profile`, executive summary, business objective, SMART metric, recommended approach, alternatives, constraints, non-goals, open questions, assumptions (flagged `assumed`), PM handoff checklist.
- Outcome report with `feature_status=requirements_ready | blocked`, requirement trace seed, completed/missing evidence, decision needed, and recommended next workflow.

## Blocking Questions

- Ask max 3 at a time with a recommended default and 2-3 options.
