# Server & Client Components

## **Priority: P0 (CRITICAL)**

> [!WARNING]
> If project uses `pages/` directory instead of App Router, **ignore** this skill entirely.

App Router uses React Server Components (RSC) by default.

## Workflow: Add Server/Client Component Split

1. **Default to RSC** — Async Server Components for data fetching.
2. **Push `'use client'` to leaves** — Interactive leaf nodes only (Button, Form, Chart). Keep layouts/pages as Server Components to maximise RSC benefits.
3. **Compose via children** — Pass Server Components as `children` to Client Components.
4. **Serialize props** — Server-to-Client props must be serializable (no functions, Dates, or Classes).
5. **Guard secrets** — Import `server-only` in modules with sensitive logic.

## Composition Pattern Example

See [implementation examples](references/example.md)

## Implementation Guidelines

- **Async RSCs**: Fetch directly in async Server Components — `await db.` queries, `await params` for route segments.
- **Data Fetching**: `fetch` with `cache: 'no-store'` or `revalidate: 0` opts out of static rendering.
- **Streaming**: Wrap slow async components in `<Suspense>`. Use `loading.tsx` for route-level skeletons.
- **Hydration**: Server sends HTML + RSC payload; client hydrates only Client Components. Server Components: zero JS in client bundle.
- **Server-in-Client**: Cannot import Server Component into Client Component.
- _Fix_: Pass as `children` prop. See [Composition Example](references/composition-security.md).

## Anti-Patterns

- **No secrets in Client Components**: Use `server-only` package to prevent accidental bundling.
- **No full DB objects passed to client**: Minimize serialized props; pass IDs when possible.
- **No `useState`/`useEffect` in Server Components**: These Client Component-only hooks.
- **No `'use client'` at tree root**: Push boundary to leaf components.

## Server-boundary checklist

- Keep server-only environment variables unprefixed and never echo client-prefix syntax when explaining secret boundaries; do not expose them to client bundles.
