# Implementation Readiness Workflow

Goal: Decide whether a planned change is ready for implementation or must return to planning/design.

## Steps

1. Load artifacts:
   - BRD-lite brief, PRD/story, SRS/FRS notes, UX/design links, implementation plan, test plan.
   - Jira/GitHub/GitLab/ADO/Figma/Confluence MCP context when configured; otherwise use exported docs or local files.

2. Check readiness:
   - BRD-lite has business goal, stakeholder, AS-IS to TO-BE, and measurable success metric.
   - ACs atomic, testable, scoped by platform/market/role where relevant.
   - PRD has stable requirement IDs, AC IDs, owner, priority, status, and last-updated note.
   - SRS/FRS identifies touched modules, API/data/interface changes, migrations, permissions, failure modes, and NFR thresholds.
   - Requirement trace is complete: BRD objective -> PRD requirement -> SRS/FRS contract -> test lane.
   - UX/design states cover loading, empty, error, permission, and responsive/mobile cases when UI changes.
   - Test strategy maps ACs to unit, integration, E2E/mobile, security, and Zephyr/manual coverage.
   - Tool prerequisites known: credentials, environments, feature flags, test data, MCP availability.

3. Decide:
   - READY: BA/PM/SRS/test prerequisites are present and implementation can start.
   - BLOCKED: missing artifact, owner, unclear AC, missing design/architecture, unavailable environment, or unresolved risk.
   - PARTIAL: only named slices can start; blocked slices have explicit owner/input.

4. Route:
   - For autonomous/channel mode, return READY only with named slices, owners, verification lanes, and available environments.
   - READY -> `implement-feature` or `dev-fix`.
   - BLOCKED -> `plan-feature` or `design-solution`.
   - PARTIAL -> slice task list plus blockers.

## Runtime Contract
- Use before implementation starts to gate go/no-go.
- Required inputs: BRD-lite/PRD/SRS artifacts plus a test strategy to check against.
- Return BLOCKED only when a required artifact, owner, AC, design, environment, or risk is unresolved.
## Handoff Payload
- `slug`, verdict (READY/BLOCKED/PARTIAL), ready slices, blocking gaps, outcome report, next workflow.
## Blocking Questions
- Ask max 3 at a time with a recommended default and 2-3 options.

## Ready Slices

## Blocking Gaps

| Area | Gap | Owner/Input Needed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [area] | [gap] | [owner/input] |

## Outcome Report
feature_status: design_ready | partially_implemented | blocked
requirement_trace: BRD-OBJ-* -> REQ-* -> AC-* -> SRS-* -> planned evidence
completed_evidence: []; missing_evidence: []; decision_needed: []; recommended_next_workflow: implement-feature | plan-feature | design-solution
